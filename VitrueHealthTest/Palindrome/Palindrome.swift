/// Multiple solutions could be used to approach that problem. All of them are working, but the intention here
/// was to try to optimise as much as possible the method.
///
/// The basis of the solution is however quite simple, if the array contains an even number of the same letter
/// and at most, one single letter, then the array can be refactored into a palindrome.
/// If the array contains more than 1 single letter, then it cannot be refactored into a palindrome.
///
/// Solutions that were possible:
///
/// - Trim the array from whitespaces and special characters, sort it and count similar letters 2 by 2.
///   Issue: Trim is O(n) and then sort is O(n log n) plus the iteration on the array which would be O(n).
/// - Use a dictionnary to store all counts for each letter, so key for the letter and value for the count.
///   Issue: Parsing the array would be O(n) and then parsing the dictionnary to get the count for each letter
///   would have been another O(n). Though this method would probably be mostly efficient-wise, similar
///   to the current implementation, using a `set` made more sense as we know letters should go by pair,
///   so in the end it's the same as adding - removing instead of having to count each iteration.
/// - Other solutions that were not at all acceptable in terms of complexity or performance and were closer
///   to a brute-force
///
///   Current implementation has some special cases:
///
///   - It does not account for special characters, meaning that
///   only alphabet is taken in account to check if the string is possibly a palindrome. Changing that would be as easy
///   as adding rules in an enum for different cases depending on accepted characters passed as a parameter.
///   That also mean that special character do not count as characters to check for a palindrome and are simply
///   ignored at the moment.
///   - Current implementation is ~ O(n), so if the string is ridiculously long, the method will take way longer. Possible
///   improvement could be to chunck the string and perform the method on each chunck in different concurrent threads.
///   Then simply substract each result set to avoid having to mutex lock a shared set. Though I still have doubts on the
///   efficiency of said method, and practical usage would recommend setting a maximum length instead. Therefor in
///   the current implementation, this issue is not taken in account.
///   Setting a maximum length would also require more testing in order to set the maximum acceptable time threshold.
///

        /// that would allow us to only parse our array once.
